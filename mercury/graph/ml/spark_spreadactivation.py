class SparkSpreadingActivation(BaseClass):
    """
    This class is a model that represents a “word-of-mouth” scenario where a node influences his neighbors, from where
    the influence spreads to other neighbors, and so on.
    At the end of the diffusion process, we inspect the amount of influence received by each node. Using a
    threshold-based technique, a node that is currently not influenced can be declared to be a potential future one,
    based on the influence that has been accumulated.
    The diffusion model is based on Spreading Activation (SPA) techniques proposed in cognitive psychology
    and later used for trust metric computations.
    For more details, please see paper entitled "Social Ties and their Relevance to Churn in Mobile Telecom Networks"
    (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3275/3d80adb5ec2d4a974b5d1a872e2c957b263b.pdf)

    Args:
        attribute (str): Column name which will store the amount of influence spread
        spreading_factor (float): Percentage of influence to distribute. Low values favor influence proximity to the source of injection,
            while high values allow the influence to also reach nodes which are further away. It must be a value in the range (0,1).
            Default value is 0.2
        transfer_function (str): Allowed values: "weighted" or "unweighted".
            Once a node decides what fraction of energy to distribute, the next step is to decide what fraction of the energy is transferred
            to each neighbor. This is controlled by the Transfer Function. If "weighted" then the energy distributed along the directed
            edge <X,Y> depends on its relatively weight compared to the sum of weights of all outgoing edges of X. If "unweighted", then
            the energy distributed along the edge <X,Y> is independent of its relatively weight.
        steps (int): Number of steps to perform
        influenced_by (bool): if True, and extra column "influenced_by" is calculated which contains the seed nodes that have spread some
            influence to a given node. When True, the ids of the nodes cannot contain commas ",". Note that seed_nodes will have at least
            their own (remaining) influence
